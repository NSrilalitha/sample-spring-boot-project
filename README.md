# sample-spring-boot-project

This is a simple spring boot application. In this application, I have demonstrated following concepts:

1. Conversion of Java to JSON and vice-versa using Jackson and Gson.
2. Exposing RESTful webservices. Sending the data to user in JSON format and XML format.
3. Type safe Configuration properties using @ConfigurationProperties annotation.
4. Implemented spring security

To consume SOAP webservices using spring boot refer below link:
